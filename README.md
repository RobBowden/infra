# Intro

The puropse of this repo is to be used for my first foray into infra-as-code or GitOPS. I am no expert and nothing here should be taken as working. If you want to see someone who knows what they are on about please refer to [ironicbadger/infra](https://github.com/ironicbadger/infra) or their blog post on the subject [The Perfect Media Server - 2020 Edition](https://blog.ktz.me/the-perfect-media-server-2020-edition/). If you are looking for a simpler solution I highly recommed [linuxserver.io](https://docs.linuxserver.io/) for a server setup instructions.

For me this is a learning experience and will be visible warts and all to encourage me to make the most of all learning opportunities that are presented to me. As I tick past the "just enough knowledge to be dangerous" into "I'm starting to understand how much I don't know" hopefully I will be able to look back on this and chuckle.
